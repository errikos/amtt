Releases
========

The latest release can be found in the |Releases| section of the GitHub |Repository|.

Normally, each release is build for Windows and Linux. Some releases may also be built for MacOS, but if they aren't you can always build by yourself, by downloading the release **source code** and following the :ref:`build_instructions` guidelines.

Release **packages** (that is, archives with pre-built, ready to run executables) are in `zip` format. Once you have downloaded a release **package**, just extract it to your desired location. Then, in order to run the translator via the user interface:

* If you have downloaded the Windows executable, run ``amtt_win32.exe``.
* If you have downloaded the Linux executable, run ``amtt_linux``.
* If you have downloaded the MacOS executable, run ``amtt_darwin``.
