Installation Guide
==================

If you download one of the amtt release bundles, there no need to install anything. The bundle consists of one executable file that can be run either via the user interface (by double clicking on the downloaded file), or from a command line (by specifying the ``--cli`` option).

However, if you prefer to build and install from source, please refer to :ref:`build_instructions`.
