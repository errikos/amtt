Installation Guide
==================

If you download one of the amtt release bundles, there no need to install anything. The bundle consists of one executable file that can be run either via the user interface (by double clicking on the downloaded file), or from a command line (by specifying the ``--cli`` option).

However, if you prefer to build and install from source, please refer to :ref:`build_instructions`.


Runtime dependencies
""""""""""""""""""""

For amtt to run (either from a bundle file or from a Python installation), you
will need to install the following.

1. **Graphviz**

   Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.

   * To install on Windows, visit |Graphviz|.
   * For Linux installation, your distribution package manager may offer a
     graphviz package. If not, the Downloads section in |Graphviz| offers
     pre-built packages for some Linux distributions (RPM and DEB based).
   * For MacOS, you can install via |Homebrew| (the packages in the Graphviz
     homepage are old).
